Over the Christmas break I came to a realization about my tech life. I have for almost 5 years totally halted my online presence due to the kind of interactions it was forcing me to have with society. I hate it be cause it keeps me from staying closer to a lot of people, but I found it was one of the best decisions of my adult life to make.

BUT, even though my social media intake dropped, the impact of tech on my day to day soared. What triggered me into writing this post was the thought that I needed a smart watch. Now don't get me wrong, I am a gadget nerd 100%, but what the smartwatch represents is essentially bringing a person even closer to their mobile phones.

So I made the decision to buy an analog watch, in particular a Seiko 5 (told you I was a gadget nerd). Yeah it's functionality is limited to telling time and kind of the day, but a mechanically powered watch is exactly what I stand for in a philosophical way. My gear should do exactly what I want in a reliable fashion, and nothing else. And plus, this watch would probably last 10x times as long as a smartwatch would since most tech gear these days are obsolete before they are released.

Anyway, keep your analog life up and don't laugh when your friends still have land line telephones!

PEACE!
