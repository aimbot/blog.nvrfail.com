Once again, on cue as always a near year begins and all of the parts of my mind that are responsible screams at me for all of the things I have left on the table as big todos from last year. I am not asserting that the things that I did not accomplish were uber important, but nonetheless it gives me bad feels that they were not completed. Alas, that is why we have our faithful "New Years Resolutions" to save the day.

It's socially accepted to slack, see! If it wasn't then there would be nothing left to do when the year rolls over. The good news is I can tick a box off of one of mine that has been lurking for years... to start blogging! Thanks for reading this, that was my second tick. Two down a thousand to go, I am starting this year off with a burnout! 

I hope you connected with this piece somehow, I am sure us slackers outnumber the normies on any day of the week. If you want some proof of that then check out the Ted talk on procrastinators; It's an amazing piece to watch.

Shawn, signing off! Will post again tomorrow, or next month... whenever I can get to it :)
