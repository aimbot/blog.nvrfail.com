Back in highschool I had an interest for photography, so a couple of months ago I started to get back into cameras. With all the advent of tech I went through a couple of cameras pretty quickly. I am clearly a gear junkie so before I get into the cameras my skill level DEFINITELY is waaaay lower than the current capabilities of my current camera.

I started with a Canon t3i, went to a 70d, then a Panasonic g9, g85, and currently a GH5. I will tell you right now, don't get caught in the gear train (I am a HUGE hypocrite lol). Similarly, since I am a manual junkie whenever I can whether its transmissions, watches, tools, or in this case, lenses! I built up a bundle of Nikon Nikkor series lenses due to their lower cost, physical robustness, and quality. And since I am not doing any run and gun and require a high end AF it works perfectly!

The process of figuring what to shoot, going to a location and then doing the act is extremely liberating for me from a creativity perspective. If you have any thoughts about finding a reason to get away from your desk on the weekends head out and take some pictures/video. Phones these days are totally capable of doing an amazing job on their own.

I will share with you my video since we are practically friends now!

Feedback is welcome, Thanks!
